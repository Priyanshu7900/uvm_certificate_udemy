# Verification Series Part 3 - UVM Essentials

I successfully completed the **"UVM for Verification - Part 3:
Fundamentals"** course on Udemy, which provided a strong foundation in
**Universal Verification Methodology (UVM)** concepts. The course
covered **UVM testbench architecture, sequence items, sequencers,
drivers, monitors, agents, environments, and scoreboards**, along with
the role of **factory patterns, configuration mechanisms, and objection
handling** in building scalable verification environments. I gained
hands-on experience in writng the modular and reusable testbenches using UVM methodolgy
